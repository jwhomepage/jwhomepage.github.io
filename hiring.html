	<h1>Instruction about positions in ASU</h1>

  Recently I have recieved many emails inquiring about potential opportunities of different positions. While I appreciate your interests in working with me, I am not able to reply to each one individually due to large number of inquiries I recieved. To help you better understand your opportunity and save your time, here I would like to explain my policies about each position as follows:

  <h3>Research Positions</h3>
<p style='color:red;'>Note: This section is only applied to current ASU students but not prospective PhD students.</p>
<br>

Unless specifically illustrated in the job postings, the <strong>Research Assistant (RA)</strong> positions with financial support will only be provided to PhD students officially supervised or co-supervised by me.
<br>
<br>

For master and undergraduate student, I welcome students who are interested in doing a thesis work with me. In this process, you are expected to enroll the CSE 493 Honors Thesis (undergrad) or CSE 599 Thesis (master) with the required number of credits in the program handbooks under my name. <strong>To ensure the success of the thesis, you should make commitment of 10-15 hours per week for 15 weeks on the thesis work. </strong> For students who are not from the computer science and engineering (CSE) program, you should double check with your program director about whether you can have me as your thesis advisor before reaching out.

  <h3>Teaching Positions</h3>

  The PhD students in the database area will be given priority for the <strong>Teaching Assistant (TA)</strong> positions of my course. Next PhD students from the CSE program in other areas will be considered. Considering the current situation, there is little chance to other students for the TA positions of my course.
  <br>
  <br>

  The <strong>Instructional Assistant (IA)</strong>  and <strong>grader</strong> positions of my course will be assigned in the descending order of priority as follows:
  <ul>
    <li type="circle"> Students who have worked as the same position before with me and the performance is satisfied.</li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who are working towards or have committed to work for the master thesis under my supervision. </li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who have worked as the same position before with other instructors and the performance is satisfied. </li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who are working towards or have committed to work for the master thesis under the supervision of other faculties in the database area. </li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who have enrolled the same cousr taught by me and got a grade of A+ or A. </li>
  </ul>
  For above students, you are encoraged to reach out to me at least SIX WEEKS before the end of the current semester. Besides, the IA positions will be available only when I am the instructor of an online course in that semester.
