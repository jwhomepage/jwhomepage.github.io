	<h1>Instruction about positions in ASU</h1>

  I am always recieving many emails inquiring about potential opportunities of different positions. While I really appreciate your interests in working with me, I am not able to reply to each one individually due to large number of inquiries. To help you better understand your potential opportunities and save your time, I would like to explain my policies about each position here. <br>
  <p style='color:red;'>Note: This instruction only applies to current ASU students.</p>
  <h3>Research Positions</h3>

Unless specifically illustrated in the job postings, the <strong>Research Assistant (RA)</strong> positions with financial support will only be provided to PhD students officially supervised or co-supervised by me. 
<br>
<br>

<p style="color:red">Currently (Spring 2026 semester) I don't have bandwidth to mentor volunteer research interns.</p> For master and undergraduate students, if you are interested in doing a thesis work with me, here is the general instruction: In this process, you are expected to enroll the CSE 493 Honors Thesis (undergrad) or CSE 599 Thesis (master) with the required number of credits in the program handbooks under my name. <strong>To ensure the success of your thesis, you should make commitment of 10-15 hours per week for 15 weeks on the thesis work. </strong> For students who are not from the computer science and engineering (CSE) program, please double check with your program director/academic advisor about whether you can have me as your thesis supervisor before reaching out. If you are good with above terms, please email me with your CV and acknowledge that you have read above instructions. In this case, I will reply within 24 hours (weekdays).

  <h3>Teaching Positions</h3>

  The PhD students in the database area will be given top priority for the <strong>Teaching Assistant (TA)</strong> positions of my courses. Next, PhD students from the CSE program in other areas will be considered. Considering the current availability of TAs, there would be very little chance for other students.
  <br>
  <br>

  The <strong>Instructional Assistant (IA)</strong>  and <strong>grader</strong> positions of my course will be assigned in the descending order of priority as follows:
  <ul>
    <li type="circle"> Students who have worked for the same position with me before and the performance is satisfied.</li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who are working or have committed to work towards the master thesis under my supervision. </li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who have worked for the same position with other instructors before and the performance is satisfied. </li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who are working or have committed to work towards the master thesis under the supervision of other faculties in the database area. </li>
    <li type="circle"> Students who have enrolled the same course taught by me and got a grade of A+ or A. </li>
  </ul>
  For above students, you are encoraged to reach out to me around FOUR WEEKS before the end of the current semester (For example, you should start reaching out in November 2025 for positions in Spring 2026). Besides, the IA positions will be available only when I am the instructor of an online course in that semester.
